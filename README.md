# Advent of Code 2021

I'm not competing in the leaderboards, so I'll be taking these at my own
pace.

I'll mostly be solving these challenges in [Roc](https://roc-lang.org).
Sometimes, I might solve them in another language first if I want to
separate the problem of solving the challenge from the problem of
implementing it in Roc.
